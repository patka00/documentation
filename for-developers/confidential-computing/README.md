# Confidential Computing

**Confidential Computing** \(or **Trusted Execution Environments -** **TEE**\) is the concept of protecting computation through mechanisms of memory encryption at the hardware level. Application being executed and data being processed are safeguarded against even most privileged access levels \(OS, Hypervisor...\). Only authorized code can run inside this protected area and manipulate its data.

Those assurances are critical for a decentralized cloud where code is being executed on a remote machine not controlled by the requester. They are, also, required to prevent leakage while monetizing data sets.
