**Prerequisities**

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) 17.05 or higher on the daemon and client.
* [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org) 8.0.0 or higher.
* [iExec SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iexec) 4.0.1 or higher.
* [Quick dev start](../quick-start-for-developers.md) tutorial.
* Familiarity with the basic concepts of [IntelÂ® SGX](intel-sgx-technology.md#intel-r-software-guard-extension-intel-r-sgx) and [SCONE](scone-framework.md#scone-framework) framework.
* [First part](create-your-first-sgx-app.md) of the confidential computing tutorial.
* [Second part](sgx-encrypted-dataset.md) of the confidential computing tutorial.
{% endhint %}

In the first part of this tutorial, we created a hello world application that runs securely inside an [enclave](intel-sgx-technology.md#enclave). In the second part, we deployed an encrypted dataset on iExec and pushed the secret to be stored safely in the [SMS](scone-framework.md#secret-management-service-sms).

In this section we will see how to combine both. Our next application will read an encrypted dataset and write its content to another file.

Go ahead and clone the tutorial repository from Github and jump in the folder `scone/hello-world-app-with-dataset`. This repository can, also, be used as a template to create your own applications.







For simplicity sake, a [Github repository](https://github.com/iExecBlockchainComputing/confidential-computing-tutorials.git) is provided. You will find all the code and file templates used in this tutorial. You can, also, use it as a starter to create your own applications once you are ready. Start by cloning the Github repository and `cd` into `scone/hello-world-app` directory.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/iExecBlockchainComputing/confidential-computing-tutorials.git
$ cd confidential-computing-tutorials/scone/hello-world-app
```

Our application's source code is a python script that echos "hello world" to illustrate a simple run inside an enclave.

{% code title="src/app.py" %}
```bash
# print to stdout
print("Hello from inside the enclave!")

# produce a result file in /scone
with open("/scone/my-result.txt", "w+") as result_file:
    result_file.write("It's dark over here!")
```
{% endcode %}



Draft:

Once you deployed your hw dataset, let's make the app we deployed previously &lt;link&gt; read it.

change code

then return to tutorial.
