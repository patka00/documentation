# Create your SGX app

## Prerequisities

To start this tutorial, make sure you are already familiar with the basic concepts of [SGX](intel-sgx-technology.md) and the [SCONE](scone-framework.md#scone-framework) framework.

* **Docker 17.05 or higher on the daemon and client**

Now let's roll up our sleeves and start playing with enclaves. In this tutorial we will be using Python as the programming language, but support of other programming languages is coming soon.



As we explained before, we use SCONE as an SGX framework.



~~Our SGX framework is based on the Scone runtime, that allows us to run unmodified apps inside SGX enclaves.~~

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
