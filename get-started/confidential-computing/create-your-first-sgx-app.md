# Create your first SGX app

## Prerequisities

To start this tutorial, make sure you are familiar with the basic concepts of [SGX](create-your-first-sgx-app.md) and the [SCONE](scone-framework.md) framework.

Now let's roll up our sleeves and start playing with enclaves. In this tutorial we will be using Python to write the application's code but we support other programming languages **listed here**.

As we explained before, we use SCONE as an SGX framework.

~~Our SGX framework is based on the Scone runtime, that allows us to run unmodified apps inside SGX enclaves.~~

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
