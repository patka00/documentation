# Workerpool Store

Workers are organized in worker pools, where participating computing powers are called ‘Workers’. As a worker provider, you can connect your machine to the network and provide computing power. A scheduler manages the work distribution. There are two types of worker pools:

* Public worker pools
* Private worker pools

Public worker pools are open for anyone to join. Anyone can also deploy a worker pool for others to join. As a worker, if you switch to a different worker pool, you will still be able to maintain your reputation score, bringing it “with you” to your new pool, as this is all recorded on the blockchain.
