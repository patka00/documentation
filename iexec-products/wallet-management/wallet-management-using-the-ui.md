# Wallet Management using the UI

## Wallet Manager

### Choose a wallet to connect to iExec 

You will need a wallet to be able to connect and access iExec services**.**

If you already familiar blockchain, tokens, and wallets, you can connect with **Metamask**, or if you are less experienced with blockchain wallets, then you can connect with **Portis** \(log in with just an email and password\)**.**

To help you decide, more details on each of these wallets can be found below.

### **Metamask**

[MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) is a bridge that allows you to interact with decentralized services directly from your browser, using a plugin.

## User Interface Guide

To help you understand how to use interface and features of the iExec Wallet Manager, we've integrated an interactive guide that walks you through the user interface.

**Wallet Address**

Your wallet address is unique to your own wallet and is your public identity on the blockchain.

**Chain selector**

Using the chain selector, you can select which network you would like to connect to.

* **Testnet** provides a training environment with **free** test crypto-currencies.
* Both **Ethereum Mainnet** and **iExec Sidechain** use real cryptocurrencies.

Remember: 

* **Ethereum Mainnet** network is great for building **decentralized** apps.
* **iExec Sidechain** is **cheap** and **fast** but is more centralized.
* The **iExec Sidechain** is linked to **Ethereum Mainnet**. RLC tokens can be transferred between them.

**Here is your Wallet**

Your crypto-currencies can be found here. When connected to Ethereum Mainnet, all transactions require a small amount of ETH to be used for transaction fees. These transactions fees are sometimes referred to as 'gas' fees. Ensure you have enough ETH in your wallet to pay these.

**Here is your iExec Account**

Your iExec account is linked to your wallet address. The account shows your credit ready to spend on the iExec platform. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
Funds must be transferred from your wallet to your iExec account. The iExec account is a smart contract linked to your wallet - iExec can no control over the funds in your account.
{% endhint %}

* When buying resources, you spend the RLC from your iExec Account
* When selling resources, the RLC earned can be found in your iExec Account
