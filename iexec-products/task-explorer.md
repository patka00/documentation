# Explorer

The iExec Explorer is a web application that can explore all relevant information about transactions, applications deployed and worker pools deployed.

For each transaction, the tool provides details on its time of execution, its hash, the user's public address, the dapp's public address, the worker's public address, the price of the deal and the status of the transaction.
