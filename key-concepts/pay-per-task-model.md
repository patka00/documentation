# Pay per task model

We are introducing a new method for pricing and we have defined several task categories that describe the execution boundaries. We’ll setup a test infrastructure so that application developers can evaluate the category of their submissions. Conversely, worker pools will be able to benchmark their infrastructures against the reference machine.

In the future, we’ll redefine the categories, and provide more advanced tools for helping developers to maximize the usage of the infrastructure
